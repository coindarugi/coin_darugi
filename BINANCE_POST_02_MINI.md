🎯 3 Crypto Trading Tips I Wish I Knew Earlier

Hey Binance fam! Got great feedback on my dashboard post yesterday. Here are 3 quick tips that actually help:

---

**1️⃣ Compare Exchange Prices**

Same coin, different prices across exchanges. I've seen $1000+ gaps on Bitcoin!

💡 Pro tip: Check multiple exchanges before buying. Save money every trade.

---

**2️⃣ Watch Volume + Change Together**

Don't just look at price. Best signal:
• High volume + positive change = Real momentum 🚀
• Low volume + big change = Risky move ⚠️

---

**3️⃣ Use AI as Your Second Brain**

I built an AI analyzer that checks:
• Price trends
• Volume patterns  
• Market sentiment

But remember: AI suggests, YOU decide! 🧠
