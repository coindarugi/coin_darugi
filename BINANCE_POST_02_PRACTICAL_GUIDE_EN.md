## 🤔 Why Compare Prices Across Multiple Exchanges?

Many traders only check one exchange before buying/selling. This could cost you **significant money**!

### Real Example:
```
Bitcoin Price (Dec 2024)
🇺🇸 Binance US:     $97,500
🇰🇷 Upbit (Korea):  $98,200
🇰🇷 Bithumb (Korea): $98,500

→ Up to $1,000 difference at the same time! 💰
```

**This is called "Kimchi Premium"** - the price difference between Korean and international exchanges.

When Korean exchanges are more expensive:
- ✅ Arbitrage opportunity: Buy overseas → Sell in Korea
- ⚠️ Don't overpay on Korean exchanges

---

## 📊 Market Cap vs Volume vs Change - What to Watch?

### 1️⃣ **Market Capitalization**
```
Market Cap = Current Price × Total Supply
```

**What it means:**
- The "size" of the coin in the market
- Top 100 = "Major coins"

**How to use:**
- 🟢 High market cap: Stable investments (BTC, ETH)
- 🟡 Mid market cap: Growth potential (new altcoins)
- 🔴 Low market cap: High risk, high reward

---

### 2️⃣ **Trading Volume**
```
24h Volume = Total value traded in one day
```

**What it means:**
- "Popularity" = How actively is it being traded?
- High volume → Good liquidity → Easy to buy/sell at desired price

**How to use:**
- ✅ Volume spike = Huge interest (big news?)
- ⚠️ Volume drop = Losing interest (correction coming?)
- 🚨 Price spike + low volume = Pump & dump alert

---

### 3️⃣ **24h Change**
```
24h Change = (Current Price - Previous Price) / Previous Price × 100
```

**What it means:**
- How much did it move in the last 24 hours?

**How to use:**
- 🟢 +10% or more: Strong rally (but watch for overheating)
- 🔴 -10% or more: Sharp drop (panic sell or buying opportunity?)
- ⚪ ±3% range: Stable movement

---

## 🛠️ How to Analyze Like a Pro (Free Tools!)

### 📌 **Step 1: Find Interesting Coins**

**Use Top 100 Browser:**
1. Sort by Market Cap → Find stable coins
2. Sort by Volume → Find hot coins
3. Sort by Change → Find movers & shakers

**Pro tip:** Cross-reference all 3 metrics!
```
Example: Top 10 volume + 5%+ gain
→ Hottest coins in the market right now!
```

---

### 📌 **Step 2: Compare Prices & Check Premium**

**Compare 3 Korean exchanges in real-time:**
- Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone simultaneously
- Auto-calculate Kimchi Premium %

**Trading scenarios:**
```
Scenario 1: Kimchi Premium +3%
→ Korea expensive = Check international exchanges

Scenario 2: Kimchi Premium -2%
→ Korea cheap = Buying opportunity?

Scenario 3: Kimchi Premium 0%
→ Normal range = Trade as usual
```

---

### 📌 **Step 3: Use AI Forecast Analysis**

**What AI analyzes:**
- 📈 Recent price trends (up/down/sideways)
- 📊 Volume change patterns
- 🔮 Short-term outlook (for reference only!)

**How to use correctly:**
```
❌ Bad: AI predicts up, so all in!
✅ Good: AI analysis + my judgment + risk management
```

**AI is a tool, you make the final decision!**

---

### 📌 **Step 4: Portfolio Management**

**Track your holdings:**
1. Enter purchase price per coin
2. Enter quantity
3. Auto-calculate real-time profit/loss

**Why it matters:**
- 💰 See total profit/loss at a glance
- 📊 Check allocation per coin (diversification check)
- 🎯 Alert when target profit reached

---

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

### 🎯 **Scenario 1: Morning Market Check (5-min routine)**

```
1. Sort Top 100 by 24h change
   → Which coins are moving?

2. Check Top 10 by volume
   → What's the market interested in?

3. Check my portfolio P&L
   → Today's profit/loss?

4. Check news for major coins
   → What happened overnight?
```

---

### 🎯 **Scenario 2: Pre-Purchase Checklist**

```
✅ Compared prices across exchanges?
✅ Checked Kimchi Premium?
✅ Sufficient volume? (liquidity check)
✅ Read recent news?
✅ Checked AI forecast?
✅ Within my risk tolerance?
```

---

### 🎯 **Scenario 3: Finding Arbitrage Opportunities**

```
1. Compare same coin across 3 exchanges
   → Upbit vs Bithumb vs Coinone

2. Price difference 2% or more?
   → Arbitrage opportunity!

3. Check if volume is sufficient
   → Can I sell immediately?

4. Calculate fees (deposit + withdrawal + trading)
   → Net profit after fees?
```
